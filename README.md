# leetcode-solutions
A repository containing all my solutions to various Leetcode problems

# What's the Point of This?
This is a way of tracking which problems I have solved. The eventual goal is to build my technical 
interview skills up to a point where I can confidently answer most problems I may encounter.

# Roadmap
I know I'm not the first to do this, and in fact there are several lists of problems curated by 
others more experienced than I. The goal is to get a few Easy questions under my belt (maybe 5), and 
then try completing lists compiled by others. Ideally, I solve at least one problem per day. 

# The Lists

# Updates:

Nov 12, 2022: Decided to only add "Easy" problems that I feel are unique/challenging enough. Some of them just aren't worth
including.
